         LAST-MINUTE CHEAT SHEET - Gallery Website Demo
              Read This Right Before Presenting!
================================================================================

⚡ ONE-LINER FOR AUTOMATED DEMO:
    .\demo-presentation.ps1

⚡ COMMANDS IN ORDER:
    1. npm test
    2. docker build -t gallery-website:latest .
    3. docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name gallery-website gallery-website:latest
    4. curl http://localhost:8080/health
    5. Start-Process "http://localhost:8080"
    6. docker stop gallery-website && docker rm gallery-website
    7. docker-compose up -d
    8. docker-compose ps

⚡ WHAT TO SAY (30 seconds each):

    TESTS:
    "11 automated tests validate HTML structure, file existence, JSON format,
    and features. All passing."

    DOCKER BUILD:
    "Building with nginx:alpine base. Copies HTML, CSS, JS, images, and
    creates custom nginx config. Image under 30MB."

    DOCKER RUN:
    "Container running on port 8080. Health endpoint confirms responsive."

    LIVE DEMO:
    "Dynamic image loading from JSON. Lightbox for full-size viewing.
    Responsive grid design."

    DOCKER COMPOSE:
    "Orchestration with health checks, restart policies, and proper networking.
    Scales to multi-container apps."

    PIPELINE:
    "5 stages: Test → Build → Security Scan → Registry → Deploy.
    Runs on every push/PR. Uses Trivy for vulnerability scanning.
    Only deploys if all stages pass."

⚡ TOP 5 QUESTIONS:

    Q: Why GitHub Actions over Jenkins?
    A: "Integrated with repo, easier configuration, better docs, free runners."

    Q: Why Alpine Linux?
    A: "Minimal attack surface, 5MB vs 130MB+, security-focused."

    Q: What if tests fail?
    A: "Pipeline stops immediately. Build and deploy never run."

    Q: How would you scale this?
    A: "Load balancer, CDN, Kubernetes, monitoring, log aggregation."

    Q: What about security?
    A: "Trivy scanning in pipeline, Alpine base, health endpoints,
        GitHub encrypted secrets."

⚡ EMERGENCY FIXES:

    Port 8080 in use:
        netstat -ano | Select-String ":8080"
        Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force

    Container won't start:
        docker logs gallery-website
        docker build --no-cache -t gallery-website:latest .
